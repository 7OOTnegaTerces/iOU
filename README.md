A new user opens iOU and reads or skips the tutorial on how to use the app.  The tutorial offers to setup/login to an account, or just start using the app right away.  The main page opens with tabbed lists for monetary, physical, service, and starred contracts that show Lender/Borrower, item, value, and date due.  Wider screens or landscape mode will give access to the additional columns of date contracted, priority level, and degree of borrower responsibility/lender leniency (a record of how prompt the borrower was to repay or the lender to allow extra time).  The user can tap the column headers to sort by that category in ascending or descending order.  The user can also tap the plus icon in the top right to create a new contract.  This button leads to the full form, an exclamation icon next to it however leads to a shortened form that only asks for name and value/item/service, with a time and date below to prompt the user to finish filling out the contract.  A third lightning bolt icon activates a voice memo recorder for the user to quickly tell the details of a contract, with a date and time to prompt to fill out the full form.

A menu icon in the top left opens up a side pane from the left.  Here the user may setup/login to their account, add a password to the app, set automatic preferences (default prompt time for fast and lighting form reminders, timing for due/near due reminders to user and any borrowers, etc.), backup preferences (in app or on iCloud), other settings (like standard currency) and, eventually, appearance.  In addition there will be links to FAQs and support, rating the app, and (possibly) donations.

At the bottom of the main list screen are icons for the calendar view (which can display in months or weeks), a search field, a button to a list of all contractees ever contracted with, and an edit button.  The edit button activates a checkmark box next to each contract for selection in batch editing.  This includes deletion, completed/uncompleted toggle, remind contractees, and forward copies to and transfer contracts to options (the latter option sells the contracts to the other party for a specified amount, item, service, as a gift, or as a recorded payment for some other contract).  The contractees list button would open up a list of everyone the user ever contracted with and their borrower and lender contract reputation as recored by the app.

When a user taps on a contract they can see all the individuals involved (in the case of a group) and their respective shares and responsibilities, all of the details of the contract as well as any attached notes, photos, or videos.  Buttons at the bottom allow the user to delete the contract, mark it as completed, remind a borrower of the contract, or inform a lender that the user is ready to complete the contact.  The full contract form (accessed via the plus icon or in a ‘please finish’ reminder from the fast and lighting options) contains options for selecting an existing or creating a new group, accessing the contacts list or typing in an individuals name, setting their level of responsibility (either in the amount they owe or are owed), which can be as all equal splits, parts, set percentages, or fixed values (the last two options also allow for one member to be designated as the catch-all if the percentages/amounts don’t add up to the full total), when the contract was set up, when it is due, designate a priority level for the contract, star it as important, and any additional notes, pictures, or videos.

A menu option would denote whether the contract was for money, an item, or a service (this would default to whatever the list menu was showing when the plus, fast, or lighting icons were pressed, or most popular for starred).  For monetary contracts the amount may be given in the standard currency of the app, or in another currency (which would be automatically converted and shown just underneath in the standard currency of the app).  For items there would be a place for a name of the item, a physical description, the general condition of the item, and the expected condition of the item on return.  For service contracts there would be a description of the service as well as minimum and maximum conditions, and a gift checkbox which would remove the conditions, priority, and the date contracted/due options.

Dragging left on a contract in the list view gives access to quick action buttons to delete the contract, mark it as completed, or remind the borrower/inform the lender.  As contracts are completed a record is kept of the contractees.  For borrowers, their responsibility is measured by when they completed the contract in relation to when it was due and how many reminders they were sent.  Borrowers may be reminded via text, email, or a message sent straight to their own iOU app.  For lenders their leniency is measured by how long after the due date the contract was completed (if it ran over), and how many reminders their iOU app sent the user’s iOU app.

The icon will be of an old fashioned scrolled sheet of paper (slightly tilted side on to the view with the top scroll curling back and the bottom forward), with a quill in an ink pot to the right and “iOU” written in cursive on the paper.  The badge count on the icon will display either the number of due contracts, or the number of due and near due contracts (changeable in settings).
